	<p><b>Synopsis:</b>
<br>
	<i>Charlie had a tought time in middle school. He doesn't go into many details about his 8th grade year, he just refers to it as when he "got bad", after his best friend killed himself and he had frequent hallucinations caused by PTSD from his childhood. He hopes to change things in high school, which he begins to do when he meets two seniors, Sam and Patrick, who teach him about close friendship, romance, and what the perks are to being a wallflower. Told through a series of letters to an unnamed "friend", The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a message to teenagers everywhere about how people blossom when they are who they are and have friends that accept them for that. </i>

<br>
	<b>Warning:</b>
<br>
	<i>This book contains some mature themes that could be triggering for younger audiences, includng depression, suicide, sexual abuse, family death, PTSD, and sex. Despite it's mature themes and scenes, it is perfect for older teens who can handle these topics. Despite the sadness of the entire story, there is some incredibly beautiful language and deeply moving messages and scenes.</i></p>
