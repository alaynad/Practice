	<p><b>Synopsis:</b>
<br>
	<i>It all starts when the 3 Baudelaire siblings recieve the news that their parents perished in a terrible fire that destroyed their entire home as well. From there, the misfortune only continues in a series of 13 books depicting the unfortunate events the children have to endure. As the books progress though, they begin to realize that maybe there was a reason behind the fire, and all of the other events that occured after it. The mystery of their parents' past haunts them just like the 3 initials V. F. D.  and a strange design like an eye that follows them everywhere they go.</i>

	<b>Disclaimer:</b>
<br>
	<i>This series is very long. While the books are short, there are 13 of them that progressivly get longer. However, the series is perfect for younger kids, so reading them at 14 years old should be a fun breeze. The books are also filled with some twisted humor that would go over the heads of the younger kids who read them, which makes them enjoyable even for older teens and even adults. </i></p>
